              It all started on a crisp autumn afternoon at a local coffee shop. Von was engrossed in a book, and
              Salo, captivated by the title, struck up a conversation. What began as a simple chat about literature
              quickly blossomed into hours of shared laughter, dreams, and an undeniable connection.

              From adventurous hikes in national parks to cozy evenings spent cooking together, our bond grew stronger
              with each passing day. We discovered a shared love for exploring new places, trying exotic foods, and
              simply enjoying the quiet moments of life side by side.

              The proposal was a magical surprise during a sunset picnic overlooking the ocean â€“ a perfect moment that
              marked the beginning of our forever. Now, we eagerly anticipate celebrating our love and commitment with
              all of you, our dearest friends and family.
